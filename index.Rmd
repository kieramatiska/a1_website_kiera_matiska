I am a first year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California - Santa Barbara. I am specializing in Conservation Planning and Energy and Climate with strong interests around species and natural resource conservation and clean energy solutions. I am from Michigan and moved to California with the goal of furthering my education to one day work on solutions to the illegal wildlife trade.
