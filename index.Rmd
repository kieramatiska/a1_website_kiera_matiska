I am a first year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California - Santa Barbara, specializing in Conservation Planning and Energy and Climate. I have strong interests around species and natural resource conservation and clean energy solutions. I plan to focus on how social factors impact conservation measures surrounding species and energy management.
