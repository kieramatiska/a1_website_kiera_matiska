I am a first year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California - Santa Barbara, specializing in Conservation Planning and Energy and Climate. I have strong interests around species and natural resource conservation, especially in terms of bushmeat, and energy conservation. I plan to focus on how social factors impact conservation measures surrounding species and energy management.

Here is a <a href = 'Matiska_Resume.pdf' target = '_blank'>link</a> to my resume.
