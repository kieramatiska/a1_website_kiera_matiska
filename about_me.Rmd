I spent a majority of my life in Michigan. Growing up, I used to find myself out in nature exploring. While I was in high school, I realized how humans are impacting the environment and knew that I wanted to do something to conserve it. During my undergraduate career at the University of Michigan, I found my home in the Environmental Science department. During my time there, I discovered interests in natural resource management, wildlife trade, and clean energy. Since arriving at Bren, I have been able to explore my interests more, as well as gain new skills involving environmental data science and environmental film making.

**Education and Career Interests**

In 2021, I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and a minor in Environmental Geology. At the university, I had many opportunities to expand my skill sets and learn more about my interests through classes and field work. Additionally, I partook in two research projects during my tenure at the university. The first research assignment I completed looked at how anthropogenic factors impact wetlands in urban versus rural areas. The other was in partner with the U.S. Geological Survey, where I worked alongside two fisheries scientists to determine the feasibility of creating two different bioenergetic models for Lake Trout (*Salvelinus namaycush*) - one model for each sex. 

In 2021, I was accepted to the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. My goal for attending 

**Hobbies**

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and pets. Additionally, I enjoy environmental photography.
