It received critical acclaim and the musical was nominated 16 times for Tony award categories and won in 11 categories. The musical was also awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It instantly became a smashing hit, with people all around the globe not only listening to the music, but striving to see it in person.\nThe musical tells the story of the Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, with the music heavy on hip-hop, R&B, rap, and soul. It is split into two acts that explore his life before becoming a major political figure and after. The musical encounters other important historical characters, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr.\nHere is the original broadway cast:\nAlexander Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda\nAaron Burr: Leslie Odom Jr.\nEliza Hamilton: Phillipa Soo\nAngelica Schuyler: Renée Elise Goldsberry\nMarquis de Lafayette & Thomas Jefferson: Daveed Diggs\nGeorge Washington: Christopher Jackson\nJohn Laurens & Philip Hamilton: Anthony Ramos\nHercules Mulligan & James Madison: Okieriete Onaodowan\nKing George III: Johnathon Groff\nPeggy Schuyler & Maria Reynolds: Jasmine Cephas Jones\nThis code will provide a text analysis on the lyrics of each song between the two acts. Word counts will be assessed, the top 5 most frequently used words per song will be graphed. Additionally, two word clouds will be generated based on the most frequent 100 words in each act. Finally, a sentiment analysis will be ran, comparing the attitudes and opinions expressed throughout each song between the two acts.\n\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\n\n# attach packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(textdata)\nlibrary(pdftools)\nlibrary(ggwordcloud)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\n\n\n\n## read in lyrics for act 1 and 2\nham_act1 <- pdf_text(here(\"data\", \"hamilton_act1.pdf\")) #

The largest one is the lack of context the computer program has when looking at each of these different songs word-by-word. Some of the songs presented were given very positive sentimental ratings based on word content, when in fact, the usage of the words contradicted this analysis. It is likely that this type of analysis would likely work better with interpreting more formal types of writing than something that is much harder to understand without context.\nData Citation\nMiranda, L.

Lake Level Changes in Mono Lake from 1850 to 2017. Located northeast of Yosemite National Park in Lee Vining, California, Mono Lake is home to a plethora of different plant and animal species. Throughout the recorded years, 1918 and 1919 had the highest lake level of 4,627 feet above sea level and 1981 had the lowest (around 6,372,30 feet above sea level). When considering wildlife distribution in the area, it is imperative to look at the lake level. Most years have lake levels upwards of 6,377 feet above sea level. When the water level is, at maximum, this high, land bridges are formed that allow predators to attack the bird species that occupy and nest on the island in the center of the lake. In 1941, water from this lake was diverted to Los Angeles to provide a source of clean water for the population there. This decreased the volume of the lake and resulted in the low lake level that allowed the land bridge to form. Once the Mono Lake Committee was formed in 1978, lake levels have started to rise again, minimizing the risk of the land bridge forming and protecting bird species nesting on the island.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nIn Alaska, Bonanza Creek is populated with snowshoe hares. Snowshoe hares are a keystone species in northern boreal forests and are therefore crucial to other species living within the same habitat (Kielland et al., 2017). They are important as prey for larger ground and air animals and can also do a lot of damage to vegetation if their population gets too large (National Parks Service, 2021). Due to lack of quantitative descriptions of hare population changes, this data was collected via capture-recapture strategies to count the population of hares in this creek. In this report, I use statistical tests and analyses to describe the changes in juvenile hare populations over 12 years (from 1999 - 2012).\nData and Analyses\nThe data set used in this report has 3197 observations of hare individuals between three sites. These sites are Bonanza Riparian, Bonanza Mature Forest, and Bonanza Lowland Mature Forest. Each observation contains data on the age, sex, weight (g), hind foot length (mm), site, left and right ear tags, date, and trap ID. For this report, calculations using t-tests (significance level: (\\(\\alpha\\)) = 0.05) and linear regression test are used to determined difference between means and the relationship between hind foot length and weight, respectively. Additionally, a Cohen’s d test is used to determine relationship effect size between hind feet length and weight and a Pearson’s r tests to determine the variance in the same relationship. Data is represented clearly in a summary table (with mean weight, median weight, standard deviation, minimum and maximum weights, and sample size) and over a multitude of different graphs. Statistical analyses are done using R coding language in RStudio.\n\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\n\n# Attach Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(effsize)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Read in data\n# - Use `read_csv()` and the here package to read in bonanza_hares.csv\n\nhares <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"bonanza_hares1.csv\")) # reads in data\n\n\n\n1.

Annual Counts of Juvenile Hare Traps in Bonanza Creek. Sample size is 378 traps.\nThe maximum and minimum amount of Juvenile Hare Trappings are 126 (in 1999) and 2 (in 2009) respectively. The median number of traps is 18.5 and the mean value is 31.5. These two values show that there has been a substantial decrease in traps since 1999. Hence, after 1999, the general trend of juvenile traps is negative, meaning that overall, the trap counts decrease from the first year onward. On the other hand, these numbers are highly influenced by effort, or the amount of time the researchers put into trapping and re-trapping these hares. By documenting the number of days in the field for a single year and then repeating that annually may lead to clearer results.\n2.

Juvenile Hare Weights (g) by Sex in Each Bonanza Creek Site Zone. The first site (‘Bonanza Lowland Spruce’) is the site used for monitoring abundance and survival of snowshoe hares via live-trapping them. The second site (‘Bonanza Mature’) consists of mature white spruce, alder, paper birch, and black spruce trees. The last site (‘Bonanza Riparian’) is the flood zone area of the creek nearby the Tanana River and the Bonanza Mature Black Spruce. The sample sizes of each of the three sites respectively are: 49 hares, 83 hares, and 246 hares.\nOn average, female juvenile hares are smaller than male hares. In each site, male hares are roughly 15 g larger in site 1, 142 g in site 2, and 105 g in site 3. Hares are the largest, on average, in site 1. Additionally, each site has different size populations of juvenile hares based on this trapping data. The smallest population is in the Lowland Bonanza Mature site (49 hares) and the largest population is in the Bonanza Riparian site (246 hares).\n3.

The effect size was small based on the Cohen’s d value of 0.2904674 and the unpaired t-test resulted in a p-value of 0.0070933. This p-value means that there is a 0.7093279% chance of finding sample means that are at least this different if drawn, by random chance, from populations with the same mean weight.\n4.

Weight versus Hind Foot Length of Juvenile Hares. Weight is in grams and hind foot length is in millimeters. Sample size is 378 individuals.\n\n\n# Statistical Testing\n\nweight_hind_lm <- lm(weight ~ hindft, data = weight_hind) # run a linear regression test\n\nweight_hind_tidy <- tidy(weight_hind_lm) # Shows lm stats\n\nweight_hind_glance <- glance(weight_hind_lm)\n\nweight_hind_pearsons <- cor.test(weight_hind$weight, weight_hind$hindft) # Pearson's R Test\n\n\n\nFor this section on the relationship between weight (g) and hind foot length (mm), it appears that there is a positive correlation between hind foot length and weight. For the linear regression model test, the hind foot coefficient is 9.52. This value means that with every 1 mm increase in hind foot length, the weight of the hare increases by 9.52 grams on average. Additionally, the R^2 value is 0.299. The meaning of this value is that 29.9% of variance in hare weight is explained by hind foot length. The Pearson’s r value of 0.55 means that there is a moderate correlation between hind foot length and hare weight. The assumptions of linear regression that may be of concern from this is homoscedesticity because the variances are unequal meaning that the variances of this relationship is actually heteroscedastic.\nSummary\nTo summarize this report, we found:\nthat hare traps decreased from 1999 to 2012, showing a possible decrease in effort of the trapping and re-capturing program of snowshoe hares\nthat there was a higher abundance of hares among the Bonanza Riparian Site\nthat female juvenile hares were, on average, slightly smaller than male juvenile hares\nthat there is a moderate, positive correlation between hind foot length (mm) and snowshoe hare weight (g)\nCitations\nDavid Robinson, Alex Hayes and Simon Couch (2021). broom: Convert Statistical Objects into Tidy Tibbles.
